The legal and financial complexities of raising funds through a presale led to the creation of several legal entities, including the Ethereum Foundation (Stiftung Ethereum) established June 2014 in Zug, Switzerland.</p>\n<p>Beginning in July 2014, Ethereum distributed the initial allocation of ether via a 42-day public ether presale, netting 31,591 bitcoins, worth $18,439,086 at that time, in exchange for about 60,102,216 ether. The results of the sale were initially used to pay back mounting legal debts and also for the months of developer effort that had yet to be compensated, and to finance the ongoing development of the Ethereum.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ethereum-frontier-launch\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#ethereum-frontier-launch\" aria-label=\"ethereum frontier launch permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Ethereum Frontier launch</h2>\n<p>The first development stage of Ethereum was called \"Frontier\". On July 30, 2015, the <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/block/1\">first Ethereum block</a> was mined and developers began writing contracts and decentralized apps to deploy on the Ethereum mainnet. In addition, miners began to join the Ethereum network to help secure the Ethereum blockchain and earn ether from <a href=\"/lexicon#mining\">mining</a> blocks. Even though the Frontier release is the first milestone in the Ethereum project and was intended for use by developers as a beta version, it turned out to be more capable and reliable than anyone expected, and developers have rushed in to build solutions and improve the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/blockwhat/13-ethereum-the-world-computer-bd22cecbc0d\">https://medium.com/blockwhat/13-ethereum-the-world-computer-bd22cecbc0d</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20131219030753/http://vitalik.ca/ethereum.html\">https://web.archive.org/web/20131219030753/http://vitalik.ca/ethereum.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/09/14/prehistory.html\">https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/09/14/prehistory.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/history-of-ethereum.html\">https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/history-of-ethereum.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"publishedOn":"2019-10-05","date":"2013-12-19","title":"Vitalik Buterin: Ethereum","author":"Marco Walz"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
