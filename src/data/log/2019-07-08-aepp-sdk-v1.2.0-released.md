In the past weeks and months Michel and Marco have further developed the [aepp-sdk-java](https://github.com/kryptokrauts/aepp-sdk-java) and added support for [Smart Contracts](https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/master/contracts/contracts.md) and [ÆNS](https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/master/AENS.md) (æternity naming system).

From now on any Java, Kotlin or Scala developer can use our SDK to deploy and interact with Contracts on the æternity blockchain.

We are proud to announce the [release v1.2.0](https://github.com/kryptokrauts/aepp-sdk-java/tree/v1.2.0). At the same time we present you a [dedicated documentation](https://kryptokrauts.gitbook.io/aepp-sdk-java/) which is hosted on GitBook.

But that's not all. We have developed a [demo application](TODO) that uses our Java SDK. This demo application will be kept up to date

The following features are currently supported by the SDK:
- generate and restore KeyPairs
   - the SDK also supports the creation and recovery of HD-wallets
- generate and restore Keystore-JSON
- Automatic fee calculation for all transaction types supported by the SDK
- Sign transactions
- service methods for generating different transaction types

The following transaction types are currently supported:
- SpendTx
- ContractCreateTx
- ContractCallTx
- NamePreclaimTx
- NameClaimTx
- NameRevokeTx
- NameUpdateTx

All services are configurable. Currently 3 networks are supported:
- `ae_devnet` (for local development)
- `ae_uat` (official testnet, SDK default)
- `ae_mainnet` (official mainnet)

If you encounter problems using the SDK please [create a ticket](https://github.com/kryptokrauts/aepp-sdk-java/issues/new) on Github and we will try to help you as soon as possible.

If you have any general questions about the SDK please visit the [official forum](https://forum.aeternity.com/c/aepplications/sdk) and ask there.
