Ahead of the [√¶ternity universe one](https://aeternityuniverse.com/) the first official [h√¶ckathon](https://aeternityuniverse.com/haeckathon) took place in the [Institute of Cryptoanarchie](https://www.paralelnipolis.cz/koncepty/cryptoanarchy-institute/). It was also possible to participate remotely but Nandan and Marco decided to fly to Prague and meet some people in the √¶ternity community in person. Unfortunately Jan-Patrick and Michel weren't able to join us. In Prague we met Guillermo who decided to join our team after we told him about our idea.

## Identity of Things: "make brands original again!
### Problem
- when you want to buy luxury items (e.g. a Rolex) you are not able to verify whether it is a fake or not
- when you receive items (e.g. medicine) in any company involved in a supply chain you can't be sure whether the package content is being compromised in between

### Solution
- a miniscule tamperproof nfc-chip with a secure element (where private keys can't get compromised) is included in the item or package
- to verify the authenticity of an item the nfc-chip is being used to sign messages
- the public keys of selected items are stored in different smart contract registries which addresses can be resolved via √ÜNS
- the registry smart contract (e.g. "Rolex 2019 limited") provides a function to verify the signed message and confirm the authenticity of an item

For demonstration purposes we made use of a JavaCard. In this specific case we used the [Keycard](https://keycard.status.im/) from the [status project](https://status.im/).

## Award ceremony: 1st place
At the end of the [aeternity universe one](https://aeternityuniverse.com/) the winners of the h√¶ckathon were announced and we are very happy that our project **Identity of Things** convinced the jury and was chosen for the **1st place**.

As Nandan and Marco weren't able to attend to the conference our friend and teammate Guillermo had the honor to represent our team and went on stage.
