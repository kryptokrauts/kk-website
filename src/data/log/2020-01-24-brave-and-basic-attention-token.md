To access the content of the World Wide Web in a user-friendly manner we all need to use a browser. Nowadays we can choose from many different vendors and probably most of us already made their choice. For all of us that haven't done it yet or aren't used to a specific browser we want to present ***[Brave](https://brave.com/kry019)*** and explain how everybody (users, publishers and advertisers) can benefit using it.

## Who invented Brave?
The co-founder and CEO of ***[Brave](https://brave.com/kry019)*** is [Brendan Eich](https://twitter.com/BrendanEich) who is well known for being the creator of [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and former CTO and later on CEO of the [Mozilla Corporation]() which created the well known and popular *Firefox* browser.

> ... the entire industry is in need of a fundamental shift from tracking to privacy by default and by design.
> <cite>Brendan Eich</cite>

## Why should I favour Brave over other browsers?
This is the question we want to give you an answer for within this article. Of course ***[Brave](https://brave.com/kry019)*** provides the typical features of regular browsers, too. Apart from [better performance](https://brave.com/brave-one-dot-zero-performance-methodology-and-results/) compared to other browsers ***[Brave](https://brave.com/kry019)*** ships with some additional features that make it unique and outstanding.

## Brave Rewards, Brave Ads and Basic Attention Token (BAT)
This is probably the ***[Brave](https://brave.com/kry019)*** feature that most people out there are interested in. Before explaining it in more detail we want to point out that this reward system is probably ***the easiest way to get people started with cryptocurrency*** at this point of time.

So if you are an enthusiast and want your family and friends to learn more about crypto you should definitely tell them about ***[Brave](https://brave.com/kry019)***.

### Brave Rewards / Brave Ads
It is important to know that **all advertisements** are being **blocked by default** and that you need to **opt-in** in order to take part in Brave Rewards.  

Afterwards Brave Ads still isn't enabled and you need to activate it in order to ***get rewards by just browsing the web***. You can also decide how many advertisements will be displayed per hour at maximum. The advertisements do not appear within the website itself but instead appear in the form of regular browser notifications.

According to the [Privacy Policy](https://brave.com/privacy/) Brave Ads is **private** and **anonymous**:

> If you switch on Brave Rewards and switch on ads (in Rewards settings) you will see ad notifications, and will receive BAT to reward you for viewing these ads. While the ads you see are based on your interests, which are inferred from your browsing, Brave Ads is private and anonymous. The data are stored on your device, and are entirely inaccessible to us. No personal data or browsing history ever leaves the Brave browser on your device.

### Basic Attention Token (BAT)
BAT is a [token](/lexicon/#token) that follows the [ERC-20](/lexicon/#erc-20) standard and lives on the Ethereum blockchain. This token is the heart of the Brave Reward ecosystem.

In the diagram below you can see the the logo of BAT which is a **triangle** that combines *users, publishers and advertisers*. These are the **3 roles** involved in Brave Rewards:

1. **Users**
   - as a user you just browse your favorite websites and from time to time get an advertisement displayed in form of a browser notification
   - for "paying attention" to the advertisement you get rewarded in BAT
   - you can enable auto-contributions to support your favorite websites
   - you can tip other users (e.g. on Twitter or Github) directly if you like their content

1. **Publishers**
   - as a publisher you can get verified by Brave and add different channels (e.g. website, youtube, twitter, twitch) where your consumers can send tips in form of BAT to
   - you can use the BAT and convert it to [fiat money](/lexicon/#fiat) or you can use it to reward your consumers or you can just [HODL](/lexicon/#hodl) it
1. **Advertisers**
   - as an advertiser you pay BAT to get your advertisements displayed to people that are probably interested in seeing it
