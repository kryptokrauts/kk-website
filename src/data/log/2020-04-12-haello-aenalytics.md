We are proud to present you a new tool in the æternity ecosystem called **ænalytics** which we have been working on quite some time. It can be seen like a regular explorer but we want to provide the ***best UX possible*** from a user perspective and also allow interaction with the æternity blockchain by allowing you to ***connect your wallet***.

Originally our intention was to release **ænalytics** in December 2019 because there wasn’t a good tool available to handle ***ÆNS interactions*** which we thought would be necessary for adoption. As this is a spare time project we weren't able to publish ænalytics earlier - but now we finally did it!

The æpplication is available for **Mainnet** and **Testnet**:
- Mainnet: https://aenalytics.org
- Testnet: https://testnet.aenalytics.org

## Strong focus on ÆNS
The focus of **ænalytics** still remains strongly on the æternity naming system. But of course we want you to be able to handle and track ***all kinds of activities*** on the æternity blockchain. We also wanted to provide a user-focused interface. That’s why you will be able to configure and track ***different addresses*** and connect to the ***base aepp***.

- in the near future we will also introduce support for ***wællet*** by implementing ***AEX-2*** in case you prefer using the browser plugin

**Note:** For connecting to the ***base aepp*** you need to turn off shields if you are using [**Brave**](https://brave.com/kry019) and you need to allow popups (a page reload might be necessary).

## Features
We want you to be able to perform ***different actions*** using **ænalytics**, e.g.:
- ***claim***, ***update*** and ***revoke*** names
- ***transfer*** tokens to other accounts/names

We want you to be able to interact with the æternity blockchain as smooth as possible and of course we will extend current features and provide even more interaction possibilities in the future!

**Note**: Currently it is only possible to update and revoke names. This will change very soon.

## Live-Demo
