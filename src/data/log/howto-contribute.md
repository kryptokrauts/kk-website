**This article contains a small guide for creating new content for the Crypto-Timeline**

To contribute to the Crypto-Timeline you can add a markdown to the timeline folder inside src/data  
Please add a frontmatter to have some meta information attached to your new timeline entry. The frontmatter
looks like following:
```
---
publishedOn: "YYYY-MM-DD"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
title: "Some title you can choose"
path: "path/to/entry"
author: "Some Guy"
icon: "fontawesome icon name"
image: "url to a cool image"
imageSource: "where you got the image from"
---
```
The date should contain the release date of the article. The title is the name which is displayed in the main section and the path is the URL to reach the article. The path should match the following pattern: timeline/\[filename\]. The icon can be any fontawesome icon name and will be displayed in the timeline (default is `fas fa-bell`)  
  
For using images try to have them with in the format of 700x280 Pixels to get the best results. Also add a image souce to make sure license conditions are met. If no image source is available the URL which is referened at image is used.

   
All the other content can be added below and does support all standard markdown.  
  
Have fun creating content for kryptokraut's Crypto-Timeline.  
  
**Thanks for you contribution!**
