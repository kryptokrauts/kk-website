On January 3, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto performed [first ever cryptocurrency mining](https://blockexplorer.com/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f) that consisted of 50 Bitcoins. The so-called [genesis block](/lexicon#genesis-block) cannot be redeemed as it was created with a unique code in it. Additionally, as part of his digital signature with a goal to preserve this historical moment, Nakamoto included a headline from the British Times issue of January 3, 2009, which said "[Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/chancellor-alistair-darling-on-brink-of-second-bailout-for-banks-n9l382mn62h)". No doubt, the headline included in the code meant to remind yet one more time that the current financial system had to be reformed.

In less than 10 days after the first mining, on January 12, 2009, Nakamoto processed world’s [first ever transaction in Bitcoin](https://blockexplorer.com/tx/f4184fc596403b9d638783cf57adfe4c75c605f6356fbc91338530e9831e9e16) by sending digital coins to Hal Finney – another cryptographer, who published a white paper called "[RPOW – Reusable Proofs of Work](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/finney/rpow/)" in 2004, which essentially was a precursor to Bitcoin.
