On May 18th in 2010 [Laszlo Hanyecz](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Laszlo_Hanyecz) published a post on [Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0) that he is willing to pay 10,000 Bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.

Only 4 days later he made the probably [most known transaction](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/a1075db55d416d3ca199f55b6084e2115b9345e16c5cf302fc80e9d5fbf5d48d) in Bitcoins early history and paid 10,000 BTC for 2 Papa John's pizzas.

If you want to know the current value of 10,000 BTC and how much those 2 pizzas are worth today you can visit the [Bitcoin Pizza Index](https://bitcoinpizzaindex.net/).

At the time of the transaction 10,000 BTC were quoted at $41.
